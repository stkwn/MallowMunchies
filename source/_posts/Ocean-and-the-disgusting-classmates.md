Okay let's get into this.
1. (my school is bad) gross classmates
have you heard of my class recently? They are so bad. Their names are Gabriella, Lucina, Argo and Ali. 

Gabriella found a dead earthworm and picked it up, then she saw a cockroach and guess what she said. She said "oh what a cutie!" in a disgusting charmy voice she dropped the earthworm and went to look at the cockroach with her other disgusting friends. 

Lucina isn't that gross, at least she's the least gross one. All she does is scoop up the bubbles near the drain and uses that to wash her hands.

Oh I don't wanna talk about Argo. He is the most gross in the squad! He would pick up earthworms and throw them at people  and whenever he's lonely he'll find some bugs to kill and pick some leaves and mash the dead bugs which include butterflies, earthworms ants and spiders or maybe even praying mantises!

Ali likes to fart and burp whenever he's bored in the classroom and make everyone laugh and he would also burp in the middle of class. people (especially me) get F- because they get so distracted by stinkiness and random er er er sounds results F-.

Well that's it
