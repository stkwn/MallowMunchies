 P.S. this actually happened today.
So My friends Potato and Browniecake came later in the story. First it was me Lexie I realised my bestest human friends ###,#####,###,######  Savanna and pusheen were frozen but they tried too. ###,#####,###,###### turned into pink moving statues?! they looked kinda slimy like slimy ocean facemasks and lip gloss. but they were just extreme smooth like the smoothest thing in the world that looks like Oshun/Ocean's favourite crystal clear strawberry scented a bunch of roseGold glitter hearts her stupid pearl mermaid hair glitter stars and of course pearls. just a buncha weird stuff! Till I realised all squishmallows were wearing stupid Solina fashion custom solider uniforms. They were glittery hot pink mild marble patterns and an ugly logo with aqua heart inside a bunch of weird cosmetics (her favourite ones) also a real glitter made rose gold ribbon with sparkly silver outline pen "Ocean rules". yes everymallow but me and my friends."gimmie all pink comestics in the world!!! Especially the sparkly ones also every pink stuff PINK STUFF PINK STUFF~" Ocean demands. all of them hunt down cosmetics that's wearing Ocean's crazy uniform. and Ocean's like " that's only 9 trillion I need more!" she's such a baby. until my friends Browniecake and Potato showed up then... OMG I'M PINK I ask my bestie human friends to help me but when they were about to ive it to them it turned pink! so I kinda had to make my own... so I splashed it on myself and I was fine again! Potato was sleeping so she still has her magic Browniecake too. till... Ocean threw a power go to her potion! now we were doomed no magic we got a big disadvantage. Then Lexie turned into a pink statue just when Ocean was putting a hypnotizing uniform Risked her life for lexie and got eaten in the end. allthough Lexie was still a statue at least not hypnotized. soon Smarty Pants ocean took over Safe Land by throwing the mayor into the Brainwash machine to erase his memory then bling! Safe land turned pink. When we got to Australia the earth was mostly pink. including Japan. until we got one of our royal friend back. Browniecake! and we made a cupcake for Ocean that had toxic powder on it. The only way to stop her is to kill her, but she said it smelled weird. so then Ocean told her servants/maids to protect her while she sleeps in a light pink massage chair then they quickly tried to make potions but Lexie was the only one who knew how to brew that type of potion so they quickly splashed lemonade on her then she quickly brewed it. Browniecake pretends to be a maid. "why does it taste so..." *dies* Now the world turned back to bright and colourful red, orange, yellow, green, indigo, blue, purple, pink and other colours all came back to the squishverse and it turned back to the beautiful squishverse we know today.
